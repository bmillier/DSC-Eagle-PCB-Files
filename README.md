# DSC-Eagle-PCB-Files
Eagle PCB and schematic files
These are the BRD and SCH files for the Arduino Shield, as well as the BRD file for the small PCB used for the DSC thermal head.
I had the Arduino Shield PCB fabricated at Osh Park Sales- 3 boards cost USD35

The DSC thermal head PCB is a PCB that I have used on previous DSC models, and was originally fabricated by Express PCB, using their own PCB 
software.
I have drawn this PCB in Eagle, and have included that file, although I have not had this board fabricated from this file yet.
